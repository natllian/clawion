# Clawion

> **🦞🦞🦞 The claw legion is ready to crush the most arduous missions.**

Multi-agent collaboration powered by OpenClaw cron jobs and the clawion CLI (wake-driven workflow).

---

## Quick Start

Install the [clawion skill](https://clawhub.openclaw.ai/skills/clawion) from ClawHub:

```bash
npx clawhub@latest install clawion
```

Then hand the rest to OpenClaw: the skill will guide your agents through bootstrapping missions, registering manager/workers, creating tasks, and running the wake-driven loop.

There's also a Web UI for humans to keep an eye on things and pretend they're in control:

```bash
clawion ui
```
